                                    To relieve the stress of the new students who enter the institute, perceiving an intense
                                    competition, in an environment entirely new to his/her experience, a No-Fail policy has been
                                    implemented. This No-Fail policy will not reduce any Academic credit requirement for obtaining
                                    the degree. Following are the salient features of the No-Fail policy -
                                    <br>
                                    ● For the first semester, the transcript of the student will not show any F grade, will show grades
                                    only for the courses which have been cleared by the student.
                                    <br>
                                    ● A course in which the student has obtained a failing grade will be treated as a course which
                                    was not registered.
                                    <br>
                                    ● The student has to pass the failed course in the subsequent semesters for completing the
                                    requirements for obtaining the degree.
                                    <br>
                                    ● Grades obtained in the First Semester by the student will appear on his/her transcript,
                                    however, No SPI (Semester Performance Index) will be computed for the first semester and the
                                    overall performance, i.e., the cumulative performance index (CPI) will be computed on the basis
                                    of the rest of the seven semesters.
